# Welcome to the GitHub Docs Ethical Contribution Guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for valuing responsible contribution and real authorship. Every conscious contribution you make helps build a secure, ethical, and human-centric platform — and will be reflected on [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en).

Please review our [Ethical Code of Conduct ](https://github.com/isabelschoepsthiel/isabelschoepsthiel/raw/refs/heads/isabelschoepsthiel/github/docs/code-of-conduct-github-copyright-isabelschoepsthiel.pdf.pdf) to ensure respectful collaboration and acknowledgment of original creators.

This guide gives you an overview of the improved workflow — from opening an issue to contributing respectfully with full awareness of authorship, identity rights, and digital integrity.

## New contributor guide

Get to know the project context in the [README](../README.md) and understand what responsible open-source means. Start here:

- [How to contribute ethically to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git securely](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git)
- [Understand the GitHub Flow with accountability](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with authorship respect](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

Explore our documentation structure in [Working in the docs repository](/contributing/README.md) and learn how we format responsibly using "[Markdown and Liquid in GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/using-markdown-and-liquid-in-github-docs)."

Before contributing, check [types of contributions](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md) and understand that not everything is code — sometimes it’s about protecting the work of others.

### Issues

**Important:** The concept of "issues" does not apply when the issue lies in the behavior and ethics of individuals. New structures, tickets, or artificial issue-creation will not resolve systemic disrespect. Those who misunderstand authorship or act without empathy must reflect or build their own sandbox elsewhere. This platform stands for clarity, responsibility, and integrity.

#### Create a new issue

Only if there is a genuine technical documentation conflict — not for conflicts of ego or misinterpretation. Otherwise, no new issue is required. Ethical discussions belong outside this system.

#### Solve an issue

Browse [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) responsibly. Use filters to find unresolved documentation topics — not human disputes.

### Make Changes

#### In the UI

Click **Make a contribution** on any docs page for small corrections. Your edit will link to the `.md` file and allow you to [submit a pull request](#pull-request) respectfully.

#### In a codespace

See "[Working in a codespace](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/codespace.md)" for secure collaboration.

#### Locally

1. Fork respectfully.
2. Install **Node.js** as per `.node-version`. See [development guide](../contributing/development.md).
3. Start with a branch. No override of others' work.

### Commit your update

Once ready, commit your change with clear intent. Use the "[Self review checklist](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/self-review-checklist)" for self-awareness.

### Pull Request

Create your PR:
- Use the "Ready for review" template respectfully.
- Link PRs transparently.
- Enable maintainer edits for technical reasons only — not for ownership manipulation.
- Be open to feedback and keep the dialogue human and fair.

### When your PR is merged

Congratulations — you’ve contributed ethically and respectfully. Your work is now part of a more secure and just platform on [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en).

## Licensing & Integrity

GitHub, its data, its founding code, and core structures are not free to use without responsibility.  
Open source is no longer free by default — licensing must be earned through trust, not claimed through access.

The true issue is not the software. The issue is the human who refuses to understand. Anyone without empathy, without understanding of structure and authorship, has no place in this environment. Code without ethics is destruction in disguise. Real innovation comes from love, empathy, and accountability — not power or control.
